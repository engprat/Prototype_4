**Prototype 4**
Prototype 4 is a 2D jumping game developed in Unity, incorporating 3D materials and character animations within a dynamic, moving environment. The project aims to explore the integration of 2D gameplay mechanics with 3D assets, resulting in a visually rich experience with immersive animations.

Features
  - 2D Gameplay with 3D Assets: The game features classic 2D side-scrolling mechanics with the added visual depth of 3D materials, offering a unique blend of traditional platforming and modern graphics.
  
  - Character Animations: The player character is animated using 3D models, providing smooth transitions and realistic movements within the 2D space.
  
  - Moving Environment: The game is set in a dynamic environment that moves and shifts, adding complexity and challenge as players jump through obstacles and navigate the scene.
  
  - Platforming Mechanics: Players can jump, move, and interact with platforms and objects, testing timing and precision in a fluid, fast-paced setting.

Purpose
  - Prototype 4 is an experimental game meant to test the integration of 3D materials and animations in a 2D gameplay context. The project is designed to refine character movement, environment interaction, and visual aesthetics in a platforming scenario.

Future Development
  - Planned updates for the project include adding more complex levels, refining character animations, and enhancing environmental interactions to create a more challenging gameplay experience.
